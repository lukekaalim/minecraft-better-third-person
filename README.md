## Features
 - **Transparent Player Character**. Change the opacity of your character to see more clearly in front of you.
 - **Mousewheel Zoom**. Instead of scrolling your inventory, in third person the mousewheel controls the distance from you to the camera.

## Roadmap
 - **Accessibility Menu**. More options to control how fresh air works should be exposed in the accessibility menu.
 - **Interaction Highlight**. Display the name of what you are currently targeting.
 - **Target Volume**. Instead of lazer-targeting the object in front of you, cast a wider net for usable entities and present a interactable list for whatever is in front of the player character.


## Compatibiliy

This is my first mod, and thus highly experimental. I used relativley invasive methods, so it's likley that this breaks compatibility broadly and randomly.

## Development

### Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.
